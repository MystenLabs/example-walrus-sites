## Sites update script

The `update_all_sites.py` script is used to update all the sites in this repo at the same time.
Note that to run the script, you _must_ have:

* the Sui CLI, configured with the wallet the _owns_ the sites;
* the Walrus CLI and config; and
* the Walrus Sites CLI and config.

Uses Python 3.11, with Pydantic and Pyyaml as dependencies.
